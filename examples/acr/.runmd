# ACR - Mirror example
- This example is a mirror setup for ACR, 
- It will demonstrate a pass_through registry that will handle sign-in w/ az-cli
- Usually in this scenario, to use `ctr` you would need to pass credentials event if you did `az acr login`
- This engine will show a mirror capable of logging in for you as you pull images
 
``` runmd
``` default call
-define a_login           process       .symbol acr_login
define b_start           mirror_host   .symbol example
``` 

``` runmd
``` example mirror_host
add node_title                      .text  Host registry mirror
add description                     .text  Example mirror host for ACR
add address                         .text  localhost:5000
add project_src                     .text  examples/acr/.runmd
```

# Example of mirroring resolve
- If artifact_type is set, resolve will attach the artifacts to the thunk_context, before resolve is called

``` runmd
``` example resolve
add artifact_type   .text       dadi-manifest
add override        .enabled 
```

``` runmd
``` required expect
define docker   which               .text docker
define az       which               .text az
define mkcert   which               .text mkcert
add stop_on_error                   .disable
add default_open                    .enable
add always_show                     .enable
add enable_connection               .enable
add debug                           .disable
add node_title                      .text Check docker is installed
```
